# Adventure Game in Python

This is a simple text-based adventure game built in Python as part of the Udacity project requirements. The game immerses the player in a fantasy world where they must explore, make choices, and face random enemies.

## How the Game Works

1. The player starts in a field with a dagger.
2. There are two main options:
   - Knock on the door of a nearby house.
   - Peer into a dark cave.
3. Random enemies such as pirates, trolls, or dragons will appear, and the player can choose to fight or run away.
4. If the player finds the **Sword of Ogoroth** in the cave, they can use it to defeat the enemy.
5. The player can replay the game after winning or losing.

## Features

- Randomly generated enemies from a predefined list.
- Interactive choices for the player (e.g., fighting or running away).
- Exploration of different locations (house, cave).
- Replay option to restart the game after completion.
- Use of Python functions for modularity and better code organization.
